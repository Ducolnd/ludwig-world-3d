# Ludwig World 3D

Ludwig is an open world survival / roguelike game. Procedually generated maps, extensive survival, interesting enemies and many items will all be part of Ludwig World in the future.

##  Contributing

Contributing is welcome. A few things that need work:

- World generation
- Entites
- UI elements (loading screen and such)
- Entity AI (pathfinding etc.)
- Better wgpu-rs work
- Textures
- Lighting shaders and code
